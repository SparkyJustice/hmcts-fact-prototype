    <p class="govuk-body-m" >
      A County Court deals with civil law cases - so disputes between two parties for example over a property,  over a contract or over a personal injury. It does not handle criminal cases. Most matters are decided by a district judge or a circuit judge. There are no juries.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body-m">
      A Family Court helps families avoid disputes or if they should arise to resolve those problems quickly.
